First Project

By Mohammad Alam

It is a simple webpage called "BandMatch." It is platform to mingle with fellow musicians for collaboration.  

Technologies Used
* html
* css

Description

It is an idea of a webpage or platform for musicians to collab or mingle with one another based on their choice of instrument. Although the actual webpage stands as a basic 
idea of a bigger picture and doesn't do much but some of the things that I'd like to incorporate is creating account and putting personal materials (music, songs etc) and
create a personal profile for others to check out.

Setup/Installation Requirements

* Simply copy the html and css file 
* Create a folder in the desktop and create a text file there
* Paste the code in the text file
* Save the text file as a .html file
* There will be created a .html icon and click on it


Known Bugs

* The "Create an Account" part doesn't work yet
